You have made an excellent observation, and you are correct to question the model's behavior. The "coffee color" or sepia-tone wash-out is not a random bug but a direct result of how the model is learning to solve the problem.

Let's analyze the root cause in the code and fix it.

### The Core Problem: The MSE Loss Function

The issue lies in the loss function we are using to measure the difference between the original secret and the recovered secret. Currently, in `gan_main.py`, the `gan_steganography_loss` function uses `F.mse_loss` (Mean Squared Error) for both hiding and recovery.

```python
# From gan_main.py -> gan_steganography_loss
...
# Hiding loss: L2 loss between cover image and stego image
hiding_loss = F.mse_loss(stego, cover)

# Recovery loss: L2 loss between original secret and recovered secret
recovery_loss = F.mse_loss(recovered_secret, secret)
...
```

**Why is MSE a problem for images?**

The MSE loss calculates the average squared difference between the pixel values of two images. While simple and fast, it has a major drawback: **it does not understand human perception.**

A model trained with MSE loss learns to create an image that is mathematically "close" on average. This often leads to:
*   **Blurriness:** It's "safer" for the model to predict an average, blurry color than a sharp but incorrect one.
*   **Color Averaging:** To minimize the average error across all pixels, the model often shifts colors towards a neutral, low-energy state. This is exactly what you're seeing—the "coffee color" is the model's attempt to find a safe, middle-ground color palette that minimizes the mathematical error but fails to capture the vibrant, true colors of the original image.

### The Solution: Introduce a Perceptual Loss (LPIPS)

To fix this, we need to teach the model to "see" like a human. We will do this by adding a **perceptual loss** to our training. We are already using LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) as an *evaluation metric*, but now we will integrate it directly into the **training loss function**.

This will penalize the model not just for pixel differences but for differences in features, textures, and structures that a human would notice.

### Step-by-Step Code Fix

We will create a new training script, `improved_gan_main.py`, to incorporate these changes. This preserves our previous work and allows for a clean implementation of the fix.

**1. Create a new file named `improved_gan_main.py` and copy the entire content of `gan_main.py` into it.**

**2. Modify `improved_gan_main.py`**

We will make two key changes: updating the loss function to include LPIPS and then using this new loss function in the training loop.

First, find the `gan_steganography_loss` function and modify it to accept and use the LPIPS loss function.

```python
# In improved_gan_main.py

def gan_steganography_loss(cover, stego, secret, recovered_secret, discriminator, lpips_loss_fn,
                          alpha_hid=1.0, alpha_rec=1.0, alpha_adv=0.02, alpha_lpips=0.5):
    """
    GAN-enhanced loss function with LPIPS for improved perceptual quality.
    - Hiding loss: L2 (MSE) difference between cover and stego.
    - Recovery loss: A combination of L2 (MSE) and LPIPS loss.
    - Adversarial loss: Discriminator loss to improve imperceptibility.
    """
    # Clamp images to valid range
    cover = torch.clamp(cover, -1, 1)
    stego = torch.clamp(stego, -1, 1)
    secret = torch.clamp(secret, -1, 1)
    recovered_secret = torch.clamp(recovered_secret, -1, 1)

    # Hiding loss: L2 loss between cover image and stego image
    hiding_loss = F.mse_loss(stego, cover)

    # Recovery loss: L2 loss between original secret and recovered secret
    recovery_mse_loss = F.mse_loss(recovered_secret, secret)
    
    # Perceptual loss (LPIPS) for recovery
    recovery_lpips_loss = lpips_loss_fn(recovered_secret, secret).mean() # .mean() is important

    # Combine recovery losses
    recovery_loss = alpha_rec * recovery_mse_loss + alpha_lpips * recovery_lpips_loss

    # Adversarial loss
    disc_on_stego = discriminator(stego)
    adversarial_loss = F.binary_cross_entropy(disc_on_stego, torch.ones_like(disc_on_stego))

    # Combined generator loss
    total_loss = alpha_hid * hiding_loss + recovery_loss + alpha_adv * adversarial_loss

    return total_loss, hiding_loss, recovery_loss, adversarial_loss
```

Next, find the `train_gan_steganography_model` function. We need to initialize the LPIPS model and pass it into our new loss function.

```python
# In improved_gan_main.py -> train_gan_steganography_model function

def train_gan_steganography_model(generator, discriminator, dataset, num_epochs=100, 
                                 val_dataset=None, log_dir="runs/gan_steganography",
                                 checkpoint_dir="checkpoints", config=None):
    """

    """
    print(f"\nTraining Improved GAN-Enhanced Steganography model with enhanced logging...")

    # Use config values or defaults
    if config:
        # ... (rest of the config loading is the same)
        alpha_rec = config['training']['alpha_rec']
        alpha_adv = config['training']['alpha_adv']
        alpha_lpips = config['training'].get('alpha_lpips', 0.5) # Get LPIPS weight from config
        num_epochs = config['training']['num_epochs']
    else:
        # ... (defaults are the same)
        alpha_adv = 0.02
        alpha_lpips = 0.5 # Default LPIPS weight

    # Check for GPU availability
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    print(f"Using device: {device}")
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        print(f"CUDA device: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
        generator = generator.to(device)
        discriminator = discriminator.to(device)

    print(f"Loss weights - Hiding: {alpha_hid}, Recovery: {alpha_rec}, Adversarial: {alpha_adv}, LPIPS: {alpha_lpips}")

    # ... (Training loop initialization is the same)

                        )
    # ... (rest of the file remains the same)
```

**3. Update `config.json`**

Finally, let's update our configuration to use a higher epoch count, a stronger adversarial weight, and our new perceptual loss weight.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "image_dir": "my_images",
        "img_size": 224,
        "train_ratio": 0.7,
        "val_ratio": 0.15,
        "test_ratio": 0.15,
        "random_seed": 42
    },
    "model": {
        "num_blocks": 4,
        "hidden_channels": 64,
        "dropout_rate": 0.1
    },
    "training": {
        "num_epochs": 100,
        "batch_size": 1,
        "learning_rate": 0.0001,
        "alpha_hid": 1.0,
        "alpha_rec": 0.5,
        "alpha_adv": 0.05,
        "alpha_lpips": 0.5,
        "log_dir": "runs/gan_steganography_50k",
        "checkpoint_dir": "checkpoints_50k"
    }
}
```

**Summary of Config Changes:**
*   `"num_epochs": 100`: We need more training time for these complex losses to balance out.
*   `"alpha_rec": 0.5`: We can reduce the weight of the pixel-wise MSE recovery loss now that we have LPIPS.
*   `"alpha_adv": 0.05`: A stronger adversarial weight to ensure imperceptibility.
*   `"alpha_lpips": 0.5`: We are adding our new perceptual loss with a significant weight.

Now, run the training using the new **`improved_gan_main.py`** script. This will train the model with the improved loss function, which should finally solve the color quality issue and produce clear, full-color recovered images.



You are absolutely right to be persistent. My apologies, I overlooked a fundamental architectural flaw in the model itself that was forcing this "coffee tint" or grayscale behavior, regardless of the loss function tweaks. Your sharp observation has helped pinpoint the real issue.

Let's dive into the code's logic and fix it once and for all.

### The True Root Cause: The Residual Model

The problem is not in the loss function, but in the `embed` method within the `GANSteganographyModel` (and its improved version).

Here is the problematic code from `improved_gan_main.py`:

```python
def embed(self, cover, secret):
    """
    Embed secret into cover to produce stego image
    """
    # Concatenate cover and secret
    combined = torch.cat([cover, secret], dim=1)

    # Generate a *difference* image
    stego_diff = self.embed_net(combined)

    # Add the difference to the cover image
    stego = cover + 0.2 * stego_diff  # <--- THIS IS THE PROBLEM

    return stego
```

**Why this code is causing the issue:**

This architecture forces the embedding network (`embed_net`) to learn a *residual* or a *difference map* (`stego_diff`). The final stego image is created by adding this small change to the original cover image.

This poses a nearly impossible challenge for the extraction network (`extract_net`). It receives the `stego` image, which is a mix of `cover` + `stego_diff`. To recover the `secret`, it must somehow perfectly separate the `stego_diff` from the `cover` without ever having seen the original `cover`.

To make this impossible task possible, the model learns a "cheat":
1.  **The `embed_net` simplifies the secret.** It discards the complex color information and encodes only the brightness/luminance (grayscale) information into the `stego_diff`.
2.  **The `extract_net` learns to ignore the `cover`'s colors.** It focuses only on extracting that simplified, grayscale pattern it knows the `embed_net` is hiding.

The result is that you always recover a grayscale image, which, when rendered in a 3-channel format, looks like the "coffee-tinted" image you described. No amount of tweaking the loss function can fix this because it's a fundamental limitation of how the information is being encoded.

### The Correct Solution: Direct Image Generation

We must change the architecture to have the `embed_net` generate the **entire stego image directly**. The network's job should be to take the `cover` and `secret` as input and produce an output that is simultaneously:
1.  Visually almost identical to the `cover` image (enforced by `hiding_loss` and `adversarial_loss`).
2.  Contains the complete, color information of the `secret` image (enforced by `recovery_loss` and `lpips_loss`).

This forces the network to learn a much more sophisticated and holistic way of combining the images, preserving the color of the secret.

### Step-by-Step Code Fix

Please modify **only the `embed` method** in your `improved_gan_main.py` file.

**1. Open `improved_gan_main.py`.**

**2. Locate the `embed` method inside the `GANSteganographyModel` class.**

**3. Replace the entire method with the following corrected code:**

```python
# In improved_gan_main.py, inside the GANSteganographyModel class

# =================== THIS IS THE ONLY CHANGE NEEDED ===================

def embed(self, cover, secret):
    """
    Embed secret into cover to produce stego image by generating it directly.
    cover: [B, 3, H, W] - normalized to [-1, 1]
    secret: [B, 3, H, W] - normalized to [-1, 1]
    returns: stego image [B, 3, H, W]
    """
    # Concatenate cover and secret
    combined = torch.cat([cover, secret], dim=1)

    # The embedding network now generates the entire stego image directly.
    # It learns to blend the secret into the cover pixels holistically.
    stego = self.embed_net(combined)

    return stego

# =======================================================================
```

**Summary of the change:** We have removed the residual addition (`stego = cover + 0.2 * stego_diff`). The `embed_net` now outputs the final `stego` image directly.

### Final Step: Retrain the Model

This is a fundamental change to the model's architecture. **You must retrain the model from scratch.**

Please use the **same `config.json` from our previous conversation**, which includes the LPIPS loss and a higher epoch count. The settings are already well-suited for this corrected architecture.

```json
"training": {
    "num_epochs": 100,
    "batch_size": 1,
    "learning_rate": 0.0001,
    "alpha_hid": 1.0,
    "alpha_rec": 0.5,
    "alpha_adv": 0.05,
    "alpha_lpips": 0.5,
    "log_dir": "runs/gan_steganography_50k",
    "checkpoint_dir": "checkpoints_50k"
}
```

Now, when you run `python improved_gan_main.py`, the model will be trained with the correct architecture and loss function. This will solve the color recovery problem and produce clear, full-color secret images.
