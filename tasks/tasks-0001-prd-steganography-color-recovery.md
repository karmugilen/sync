## Relevant Files\n\n- `Z:\\sync\\improved_gan_main.py` - The main implementation file that needs to be updated with LPIPS loss and direct image generation\n- `Z:\\sync\\config.json` - Configuration file that needs updates for new loss parameters\n- `Z:\\sync\\tasks\\0001-prd-steganography-color-recovery.md` - The PRD that outlines the requirements\n\n### Notes\n\n- The implementation will focus on the improved_gan_main.py file since it already shows an enhanced implementation\n- Changes will include adding LPIPS loss to the training function and modifying the embed method\n- The model will need to be retrained from scratch due to architectural changes\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] 1.0 Update the loss function to include LPIPS\n  - [ ] 1.1 Modify `gan_steganography_loss` function to accept LPIPS loss function parameter\n  - [ ] 1.2 Add LPIPS loss calculation for recovery in the loss function\n  - [ ] 1.3 Combine MSE and LPIPS losses for the recovery component\n- [ ] 2.0 Modify the embed method to use direct image generation\n  - [ ] 2.1 Update the `embed` method in the GANSteganographyModel class to remove residual addition\n  - [ ] 2.2 Make the embedding network generate the complete stego image directly\n- [ ] 3.0 Update the training function to initialize and use LPIPS loss\n  - [ ] 3.1 Initialize LPIPS loss function in the training function\n  - [ ] 3.2 Pass LPIPS loss function to the loss calculation function\n  - [ ] 3.3 Update training loop to use new loss function with LPIPS\n  - [ ] 3.4 Update validation loop to use new loss function with LPIPS\n- [ ] 4.0 Update configuration file with new parameters\n  - [ ] 4.1 Add alpha_lpips parameter to config.json for LPIPS loss weight\n  - [ ] 4.2 Adjust other parameters as needed for new loss function\n- [ ] 5.0 Update the main function to pass new parameters\n  - [ ] 5.1 Update main function to read new LPIPS parameter from config\n  - [ ] 5.2 Pass the parameter to the training function
