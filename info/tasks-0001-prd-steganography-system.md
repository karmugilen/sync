### Notes
- The basic steganography functionality is already implemented

- GUI applications exist but may need updates to support GAN-enhanced models
- Configuration loading is already implemented but needs updates for GAN parameters
- Quality metrics need to be expanded to include perceptual metrics like LPIPS
