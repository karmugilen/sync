# 0001-PRD: AI-Powered Image Steganography System with GAN Integration

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the requirements for an AI-powered steganography system that enables users to hide and reveal image-based data within other images using deep learning models enhanced with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The system leverages neural networks to securely embed one image (the "secret") within another image (the "cover") to create a "stego" image. The stego image appears visually identical to the cover image but contains the embedded secret. A discriminator network ensures the stego image is indistinguishable from the cover image, while the extraction network can retrieve the secret image from the stego image without requiring access to the original cover image.

The system addresses the need for a secure, AI-based method to conceal sensitive image information within seemingly ordinary images, providing a layer of security for data transmission and storage.

## 2. Goals

1. Implement a GAN-enhanced neural network-based system that can embed one image within another with minimal visual distortion
2. Enable reliable extraction of the hidden image from steganographic images without requiring the original cover image
3. Provide both GUI and command-line interfaces for embedding and extracting data
4. Ensure the system works with common image formats (PNG, JPG)
5. Maintain reasonable processing speed for image encoding and decoding
6. Achieve high quality of steganographic images compared to original images (PSNR > 40dB, SSIM > 0.95)
7. Support both pre-trained models and model training capabilities with GAN integration
8. Provide comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualization tools

## 3. User Stories

4. The discriminator network must distinguish between cover images and stego images to enforce imperceptibility
